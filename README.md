# musical-instrument-detection
Machine learning

The primary aim of this model is classification of an audio file into a specific instrument classification using machine learning algorithms. 
In the proposed work music instrument recognition will be done using deep convolution neural network. 
 The system will receive input in the form sampled audio signal which further will be converted to Mel spectrogram form.
 Softmax function will be used which calculate the probability of each musical instrument used in the audio signal and accuracy of our model will be calculated![image]
